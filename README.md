These two files are my part of the project I worked on in my Tierra South Florida internship over last summer. This project is meant to help engineers and construction workers visualize and detect errors in construction based on specific values they input. The VolumeIssueChecker.java file outputs whether or not there is a volume issue in the drill shaft based on specific user input values. The DrawGraph.java file outputs a linear graph that displays Concrete Volume (cy) values on the x-axis and Shaft Length (ft) values on the y-axis based on the values the user enters.

I've worked on numerous Python problem sets as well, but those files were deleted once I uninstalled and the old version and installed the new version of PyCharm on 
my laptop.
