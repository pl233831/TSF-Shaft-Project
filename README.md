These two files are my part of the project I worked on in my Tierra South Florida internship over last summer. The VolumeIssueChecker.java file outputs 
whether or not there is a volume issue in the drill shaft based on specific user input values. The DrawGraph.java file outputs a linear graph that displays 
Concrete Volume (cy) values on the x-axis and Shaft Length (ft) values on the y-axis.
